    <p class="is-size-3">The goal of Sarva Dharma Service Center, NJ, USA is to be part of Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba’s mission on Earth, spiritual uplift of all regardless of faith, spiritual education of children and adults and above all service to humanity.</p>
    <div class="is-size-6">
      <p>The need to have a permanent facility for Sai Activities in a central place in Mid-Atlantic states was felt by many devotees since early 1991. A prayerful request was presented to Svaami in September 1992 and He blessed it. A goal was set and efforts to realize it soon started. The progress made on the project was periodically presented to Bhagavan and received His gracious Blessings and directives such as <strong>“you must do it”, “good project”- “Svaami Happy”, “you must do Service to Humanity” and as late as July 2000, “with Svaami’s Grace it will materialize, but human efforts have to be there”</strong>.</p>
      <p>The project is to provide a Sai Spiritual focus for the area and a place of sanctity and haven for spiritual uplift of all Sai families to come together and conduct spiritual and service activities such as Bhajans, as well as spiritual education for children and adults of all faiths. It will also be the central place for planning several service activities including distribution of food and clothing for the needy.</p>
      <p>The project was officially launched as a nonprofit entity and incorporated in New Jersey on November 23, 1993 as “Sri Sathya Sai Service Center Inc.” A constitution with By-laws was formed and office bearers were selected following Svaami’s guidelines for leaders. The name was changed to <strong>“Sarva Dharma Service Center Inc.”</strong> in 1995, so as not to involve Svaami’s name in financial and legal contracts.</p>
      <p>By the Grace of Bhagavan, Sarva Dharma Service Center Inc. was able to purchase a 9-acre land in serene surroundings in Howell Township, NJ in June 1997. The property is conveniently located and is close to major highways. In July 2000, <strong>Svaami reviewed our building plans and assured us by pronouncing: "BY SWAMI'S GRACE, THIS WILL MATERIALIZE"</strong> and suggested a budget. In October 2001, the town planning board approved a 16,000 sq. ft. building to be constructed on the site in two phases. Construction is targeted to start in summer 2002.</p>
      <p>Financial aspects of the project are in strict adherence to the guidelines Bhagavan has laid down. Solicitation of donations or fund raising was never done and will never be done in any phase of the project. All funds were and will be from voluntary donations and all donations are kept anonymous except as required by law.</p>
      <p>For the past several years the center has been involved in several service activities within New Jersey. These activities include, but not limited to, serving food for the less fortunate in Trenton and New Brunswick, provide free services to the Library For the Blind in fixing the tape recorders, etc. The Center also organizes group prayers (Namasmarana), free health fairs, multi faith meetings and few service activities in various parts of the world.</p>
