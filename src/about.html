      The mission of Sarva Dharma Service Center, Inc. is to provide humanitarian community services and conduct community
      activities to promote unity among all by  following Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba's messages of "Love All Serve All" and "Help Ever Hurt Never".

        Sathya Sai Baba is one of the most revered spiritual teachers in the world. He is also known as Sri Sathya Sai
        Baba, Sai Baba, Swami, Bhagavan or simply as Baba to millions of people in the world.
        You can learn more about Him by clicking <a href="http://www.sathyasai.org/sathya-sai/life-and-legacy">here</a>.

      <p>
        Inspired by Baba's teachings and His Love in action, a group of followers from United States went to India in
        September 1992 and
        presented to Him a proposal to construct a permanent facility in Mid-Atlantic states of USA which is open for
        all, to congregate and
        conduct activities in accordance to His teachings that promote both spiritual and physical well being of an
        individual.
        Bhagawan Baba has graciously blessed it and provided guidance over the years. One of His key directives for the
        Center is to "<strong>run it as a service center helping the community and not as a temple</strong>".
        Financial aspects of the project are in strict adherence to the guidelines laid down by Bhagawan.
        Solicitation of donations or formal fund raising was never done. All funds were and will be from voluntary
        donations and all donations are kept anonymous except as required by law.
